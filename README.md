# Task-03: Text Generation with Markov Chains

This repository contains **Task-03** of my **Generative AI Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
In this task, I implemented a **word-level Markov chain** model to generate motivational text based on a large dataset.

---

## 📝 Overview

- Implemented **Markov Chain** for text generation  
- Preprocessed a large dataset (motivational quotes + company info)  
- Generated coherent text using statistical probabilities of word sequences  
- Built an **interactive frontend** using **Gradio** to demo the model

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. Use the **Gradio interface** to enter a topic and generate motivational text

## 📈 Demo

- Enter a topic like: `success`, `life`, `goals`  
- Output: Motivational quote generated using Markov chain  
- Example screenshot/video available in `screenshots/`

## 💡 Note

This repository is part of the **Generative AI Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
Outputs may vary due to the random nature of Markov chain generation.
